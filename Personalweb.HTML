		<p><b>My grandfather took care of me from the time I was 3–4 years old until I was 7 years old because my parents were working here in Las Piñas, so I was left in Pangasinan.
		My grandfather always eats with me, sleeps next to me, and picks me up from school, but when I was 7 years old, my parents brought me here to CAA.
		Even though my grandfather and I only met once because we only went back to Pangasinan once, he still hasn't changed. 
		He's still kind to me and he still takes care of me. My last birthday was chosen to be celebrated at pangasinan, so I can with my grandfather, but I didn't think it would be the last birthday that I would be with him because on September 25, 2022, he died suddenly.
		I couldn't accept what happened. because my grandfather is still strong and he doesn't say anything about his illness.
		It hurts to think that I won't be able to talk to him and hug him. I miss him so much.</b></p>

			<p><b>Friendship never leaves us in bad times. You learn how to understand people and trust others. Your real friends will always motivate you and cheer for you.
			They will take you on the right path and save you from any evil. Similarly, friendship also teaches you a lot about loyalty.</b></p>
